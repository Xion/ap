## base



### identity

Identity function.
### flip

Create a function that invokes given one with arguments reversed.
### len

Compute the length of given value (an array or a string).
### rev

Reverse the value.
For strings. this reverses the order of characters (Unicode grapheme clusters, to be precise).For arrays, the result is an array with reversed elements.
For objects, the result is an inverted object, i.e. one where values from inputmap back to keys. If there is more than one value for any given key,it is undefined which one will be present in the result.
### keys

Return an array of object's keys.If a string or array is passed, an array of indices is returned.
### values

Return an array of object's values.
### pick

Pick only the values from given collection that match the keys.Keys should be given as an array.Source collection can be:* an array (with element indices as keys)* an object* a string (with character indices as keys)
### omit

Opposite of pick(). Preserves only the values from given collectionswhose keys/indices *don't* match the keys/indices from given array.Source collection can be:* an array (with element indices as keys)* an object* a string (with character indices as keys)
### index

Find an index of given element inside a sequence.Returns an empty value if the element couldn't be found.
### all

Returns true if all elements of an array are truthy (as per bool() functions).Note that if the array is empty, it also returns true.
### any

Returns true if at least one element of the array is truthy(as per the bool() function).
### min

Find a minimum value in the array. Returns nil for empty arrays.
### max

Find a maximum value in the array. Returns nil for empty arrays.
### sum

Return a sum of all elements in an array.
### map

Map a function over an array.Returns the array created by applying the function to each element.
### filter

Filter an array through a predicate function.This is the opposite of reject().
Returns the array created by applying the function to each elementand preserving only those for it returned a truthy value.
### reject

Reject array elements that do not satisfy a predicate.This the opposite of filter().
Returns the array created by applying the function to each elementand preserving only those for it returned a falsy value.
### compact

Returns the array with all falsy values removed.This is determined via the bool() conversion.
### reduce

Apply a binary function cumulatively to array elements.Also known as the "fold" operation (left fold, to be precise).
### sort

Sort the array using a default comparison method.
The only kinds of sortable values are numbers (integers & floats (sans NaN))and strings (alphabetically). They do not compare to each other, though.
Returns the array after sorting.
### sort_by

Sort the array using a comparator.
The comparator should be a function that takes two values and returns:* a negative number - if the first value is lower than the second one* zero - if the both values are equal* a positive number - if the first value is greater than the second one
Returns the array after sorting.

## random



### rand_


### shuffle

Shuffle the elements of an array or characters in a string.
### sample

Pick a sample of given size among the values from a collection.Returns the array of picked elements.

## api




## conv



### bool

Convert a value to a boolean, based on its "truthy" value.
NOTE: This conversion is used by logical (!, &&, ||) and conditional (:?)operators to coerce values to boolean whenever necessary.
### int

Convert a value to an integer.
### float

Convert a value to a float.
### str_

Convert a value to string.
### regex

Convert a value to a regular expression.If not a string, the value will be stringified first.
### csv

Converts a value to or from CSV:* string input is converted from CSV into an array (of arrays) of strings* array input is converted to CSV string
### json

Converts a value to or from JSON:* an array or object input is converted to JSON string* a string input is parsed as JSON

## math



### abs

Compute the absolute value of a number.
### sgn

Compute the signum function.
### sqrt

Compute a square root of a number.
### exp

The exponential function.
### ln

Natural logarithm (with respect to base 'e').
### floor

Round a number down (towards negative infinity).
### ceil

Round a number up (towards positive infinity).
### round

Round a number to the nearest integer.
### trunc

Return the integer part of the number (round towards zero).
### bin

Convert an integer to a binary string.
### oct

Convert an integer to an octal string.
### hex

Convert an integer to a hexidecimal string.
